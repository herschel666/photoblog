In July of 2020 I walked the first half of the "Traumpfad" — a hiking trail from Munich to Venice
across the Alps — together with a friend. Due to a lack of time, we only made it to the Dolomites,
which took us 14 days. We also had to skip the _Lizumerhütte_ and the _Tuxerjochhaus_ because of
heavy rain. So instead of being stuck in one of the huts and then having to take the bus to be able
to stick with our schedule, we rather went to Brennero by train, climbed up to the _Europahütte_ in
a light drizzle and went straight to the _Olperer Hütte_ the next day via the _Peter-Habeler-Runde_.

I decided to not buy a camera before going on the trip. So every photo has been taken with my
smartphone. I'm pretty fine with the result, although — to be honest — the set is more or less a
collection of postcard motives.
