A few days ago something rare happened in Hamburg: snow was falling without turning into mud right after touching ground. So I decided to go out and catch the scenery while it lasted. When I started my little trip it was -5° C cold. After almost 3 hours of roaming through Ottensen, the display of my camera stopped working. By then temperature has fallen to -9° C and I was happy to head home again.

Personally I think a little more snow would have bee good. But I don't want to complain … :-D
